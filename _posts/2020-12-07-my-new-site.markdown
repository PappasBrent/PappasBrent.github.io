Hello! I've recently decided to remake my personal website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Previously, my website was hosted through GoDaddy. I have decided to switch to GitHub Pages and Jekyll for a few reasons:
- GitHub Pages is cheaper (completely free, sans the domain name).
- Creating a static site in Jekyll is WAY easier than manually creating a site myself. This is because Jekyll provides features such as layouts and includes to keep my HTML code [DRY](https://www.drycode.io/), and allows me write pages in Markdown instead of HTML.


These features are so handy that I have decide to try writing a blog (hence this first post). I will most likely write mainly about programming and programming-adjacent topics, but I may occasionally dip into other subjects if something catches my attention.

I will probably be updating the layout of this site in the future as I learn more about Jekyll, so stay tuned!
